📖 About Zapprompter

Zapprompter is a modern web-based prompt generator designed to make content creation simple, fast, and creative. The frontend provides an easy-to-use interface where users can enter their ideas and instantly receive well-structured prompts. What makes Zapprompter unique is its integration with a custom Gemini Gem built by me, which powers the backend. This Gem acts as the brain of the application, processing user input and generating high-quality, context-aware prompts. By combining a sleek interface with the intelligence of my Gemini Gem, Zapprompter delivers a seamless experience for students, developers, and content creators who want to explore and experiment with prompt engineering.
